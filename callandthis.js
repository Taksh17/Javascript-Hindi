//call function:-
function setusername(username){
    this.username=username
}
function mylife(username,email,password){
    setusername.call(this,username)

    this.email=email
    this.password=password
}
const chai=new mylife('chai','taksh@gmail','123');
console.log(chai);
/*2. Step-by-Step Execution
Step A: new mylife('chai','taksh@gmail','123')

When you call a function with new:

A new empty object is created.

That object is linked to the function‚Äôs prototype (mylife.prototype).

Inside mylife, the keyword this refers to that new object.

Unless you explicitly return something else, the new object is returned at the end.

So here, this inside mylife ‚Üí refers to the new object {} being constructed.

Step B: setusername.call(this, username)

setusername is another function that sets this.username = username.

Normally, if you just called setusername(username), this would not point to your mylife object.

That‚Äôs why you used .call(this, username):

.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ‚Ä¶) runs the function with this = thisArg.

Here this is your mylife object, so you are telling JS:

‚ÄúHey setusername, run as if you were called inside mylife‚Äôs object context.‚Äù

So now the property is added:

this.username = 'chai';

Step C: The rest of mylife
this.email = email;      // this.email = 'taksh@gmail'
this.password = password; // this.password = '123'


So your object becomes:

{
  username: 'chai',
  email: 'taksh@gmail',
  password: '123'
}

3. Final Output
mylife {
  username: 'chai',
  email: 'taksh@gmail',
  password: '123'
}

4. Concept Recap

new keyword
Creates a new object, binds this to it, and returns it.

call method
Lets you call a function and manually set what this should refer to.

Code design pattern you used:

setusername is a helper function.

mylife reuses setusername by borrowing it with .call(this, ...).

This way, multiple constructors can share common logic without repeating code.

‚úÖ That‚Äôs why your code works: you explicitly ensured that setusername updates the this object of mylife.

Do you want me to also compare this with using class syntax (class MyLife {}) so you see how modern JS does the same thing more cleanly?

Nice üëå You‚Äôve hit on a really interview-worthy JavaScript topic: functions as constructors, this, call, apply, bind, and new.

Here are some common interview questions (with answers) you could be asked based on your example:

1. What does the new keyword do in JavaScript?

‚úÖ Answer:
When you use new with a function:

A new empty object is created.

That object‚Äôs prototype is set to the function‚Äôs .prototype.

The function is called with this bound to the new object.

Unless the function returns another object, the new object is returned.

2. Difference between calling a function with and without new?
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
const u1 = User('chai');     // called as regular function
const u2 = new User('chai'); // called as constructor


User('chai') ‚Üí this is undefined in strict mode, or window in non-strict ‚Üí pollutes global scope.

new User('chai') ‚Üí this is a brand-new object { name: 'chai' }.

3. What‚Äôs the difference between .call(), .apply(), and .bind()?

call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ‚Ä¶) ‚Üí immediately invokes the function with this set to thisArg.

apply(thisArg, [args]) ‚Üí same as call but takes arguments as an array.

bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ‚Ä¶) ‚Üí doesn‚Äôt call immediately, returns a new function with this permanently bound.

Example:

function greet(msg) { console.log(msg, this.name); }
greet.call({name:'Taksh'}, 'Hello'); // Hello Taksh
greet.apply({name:'Taksh'}, ['Hi']); // Hi Taksh
const fn = greet.bind({name:'Taksh'}, 'Hey');
fn(); // Hey Taksh

4. Why did we use setusername.call(this, username) in your code?

Because if we just did setusername(username), this inside setusername wouldn‚Äôt point to the mylife object.
.call(this, username) makes sure this inside setusername is the current object being constructed.

5. What is function borrowing?

Using .call() or .apply() to reuse methods from another object/function.
Your setusername inside mylife is an example of function borrowing.

6. How is this related to classes in ES6?

Your code can be rewritten in modern syntax:

class MyLife {
  constructor(username, email, password) {
    this.username = username;
    this.email = email;
    this.password = password;
  }
}
const chai = new MyLife('chai', 'taksh@gmail', '123');
console.log(chai);


Classes are syntactic sugar over constructor functions and prototypes.

7. What happens if you forget new when calling a constructor function?

this won‚Äôt point to a new object.

In strict mode: this = undefined ‚Üí error.

In non-strict mode: this = global object (window in browser), leading to bugs (global pollution).

8. What is shadowing in function parameters?

In your earlier code:

function mylife(username, email, password) {
   setusername.call(this, username);
   ...
}
Here, username (the parameter) shadows the setusername function‚Äôs name.
If both had same name ‚Üí confusion and bugs.
